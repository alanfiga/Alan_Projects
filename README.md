# Alan's Projects
This Repository is to share some of the projects, work, knowledge and experience of Alan Figueroa (The Author). 

## Portfolio Black and Litterman
Is a file that shows how to use PyPortfolioOpt Library to build Financial Portfolios. In that file I used Black & Litterman settings to compare between 4 differents portfolios that has different expected view from the investor. The 4 view was build using Deep Learning & Recurrent Neural Networks.


## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN-Expectativas)
In this file I build a Recurrent Neural Network with Keras and Tensorflow to predict the time series of 14 Stock Markets.
